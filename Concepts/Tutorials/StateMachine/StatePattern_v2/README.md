State Design Pattern 
An object should change its behavior when its state changes.
State-specific behavior/code should be defined independently.

This is achieved by moving the state specific code into State classes/objects. The main class (called Context) keeps track of its state and delegates the behavior to the State objects.

The Context holds a reference to its current State and delegates the execution of request() to state.handle().
Each State object implements the handle() function. This is the state-specific behavior that gives us encapsulation and reuse.


Using a State Design Pattern over Switch and If statements and over State Machines is a powerful tool that can make your life easier and save your employer time & money. Itâ€™s that simple.
